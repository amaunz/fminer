=FMiner (A chemical fragment miner)
Andreas Maunz, 2008.
FMiner is a chemical fragment miner for anti-monotonic and convex constraints. Currently, minimum frequency and chi-square constraints are supported.
It is a modified version of Gaston (see below).


==Switches (run fminer w/o arguments for allowable parameter ranges, defaults and explanations):

===File Switches:
- -s Smiles file 
- -a Activity file

===Constraint parameters:
- -l Subgraph type, choices are paths, trees, and graphs.
- -f Minimum frequency constraint, used for anti-monotonic pruning.
- -p Chi-square significance level, used for statistical upper-bound pruning.

===Constraint switches:
- -c Switch off mining of only the most significant/most general representative of each backbone.
- -x Deactivate upper bound pruning for chi-square constraint (less efficient, use only for performance evaluation).
- -j Deactivate dynamic adjustment of upper bound (less efficient, use only for performance evaluation). Can only be set when -c is not set.

===Remarks:
- Structures are output to STDOUT in YAML format, everything else to STDERR.
- Given an activity file the chi-square test is automatically activated. Output of occurence lists is also activated for each of the two classes.
- Define equivalence classes for subtrees to avoid redundancy in the solution set. Two trees are equivalent, if one is a subtree of the other. 

==Examples:

1) Run:
./fminer -s data/hamster_male_carcinogenicity.smi -a data/hamster_male_carcinogenicity.class -p0.5 -c > outfile.yaml

2) Run without pruning:
./fminer -s data/hamster_male_carcinogenicity.smi -a data/hamster_male_carcinogenicity.class -p0.5 -c -x > outfile.pr.yaml

3) Run with free structures:
./fminer -s data/hamster_male_carcinogenicity.smi -a data/hamster_male_carcinogenicity.class -p0.5 > outfile.yaml

4) Run without adjustment of upper bound and free structures:
./fminer -s data/hamster_male_carcinogenicity.smi -a data/hamster_male_carcinogenicity.class -p0.5 -j > outfile.yaml


1) and 3) should outperform 2) and 4), respectively.
