File Formats:
- Graphs are allowed in SMILES and gSpan format. This is to support both general graph mining, but to also make life more convenient when mining molecular data. For instance, for SMILES formatted input there is a switch to enable/disable aromatic ring perception, which, in gSpan format, requires re-formatting the input.
  
  SMILES file line format is defined by 
    "ID\t SMILES", e.g.:
     1    COC1=CC=C(C=C1)C2=NC(=C([NH]2)C3=CC=CC=C3)C4=CC=CC=C4

  gSpan file block format (see also: http://illimine.cs.uiuc.edu/resources/readme_plain.php?program=gSpan) is defined by:
    "t # ID" means the Nth graph,
    "v M L" means that the Mth vertex in this graph has label L,
    "e P Q L" means that there is an edge connecting the Pth vertex with the Qth vertex. The edge has label L.

- Activity file line format is defined by 
    "ID\t endpoint\t activity", e.g.:
     1    Salmonella Mutagenicity    1

The set of IDs in a gSpan or SMILES format file must be a subset of the set of activity IDs in the respective activity format file, i.e., not every Activity ID must be matched by a graph id, but vice versa.



Switches (run Fminer w/o arguments for allowable parameter ranges, defaults and explanations):

 Constraint parameters:
 -f Minimum frequency constraint, used for anti-monotonic pruning.
 -l Subgraph type, choices are paths and trees.
 -p Chi-square significance level, used for statistical upper-bound pruning.

 Constraint switches:
 -d Deactivate dynamic adjustment of upper bound (less efficient, use only for performance evaluation). Can only be set when -c is not set.
 -b Switch off mining of only the most significant/most general representative of each backbone.
 -u Deactivate upper bound pruning for chi-square constraint (less efficient, use only for performance evaluation).

 General switches:
 -s Refine fragments with frequency 1.
 -a Disable aromatic ring perception for SMILES input.
 -o Switch off output.

 Environment variables:
 Define the FMINER_SMARTS environment variable to produce output in SMARTS format (e.g. export FMINER_SMARTS=1).
 Additionally define the FMINER_LAZAR environment variable to produce output in linfrag format which can be used as input to Lazar (e.g. export FMINER_LAZAR=1).

 Remarks:
 Structures are output to STDOUT in the specified format.
 Output consists of blocks of gSpan graphs.
 When using SMARTS output (FMINER_SMARTS defined), each line is a YAML sequence, containing SMARTS fragment, p-value, and two sequences denoting positive and negative class occurrences (line numbers in Smiles file). When FMINER_LAZAR is set, the linfrag output format is used.
